# FinanceFunctions
  I created this project to practice taking financial equations, and translating them into useful python functions. The main skill I am cultivating with this project is taking useful, real world mathematical models, and transforming them into functional, useable programs. This is a skill I know will be essential in my future work as a data analyst.
